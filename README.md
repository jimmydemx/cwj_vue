# 1. Introduction

 Vue is one of the 3 popular MVVM framework of Javascript, this project is meant to achieve an comprensive explanation of the Core of Vue.Js. here some keypoints of Vue.JS are enumerated as below,

- Components Communication
- the pouplar APIs
- Reactivity
- Vuex and Vue Router Plugin
- SSR realization
- Source Code 

# 2. A Youtube Project

It also belongs to  `Code with James` Project, so the corresponding videos can be found in my channel in [Youtube Playlist](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCrBUBSCT4ds02d4id3DBWwA/playlists). As video is a more intuitive way to learn and share knowledge, please feel free to leave any comment in my channel and subscribe to always get the latest contents.
All the steps and key points has been illustrated in Youtube. It is an honor to discuss the Vue.JS with the Author(you can start with HiÔºÅ@James XD)

Each video would like to cover a list of key Points. Most important, the Videos tries to provide a clear methodology to cope with code, hence help to improve the overall programming skills.

## 2.1 VueX 
the link of Youtube Video: 
-[Polyfill VUeRouter_1](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G5omujBLJ_Q)
-[Polyfill VUeRouter_2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k6suGfgBwIE)
related files:
- `/src/PStore/vuex.js` : polyfill VueX
- `/src/APP.vue`: include the component 

the Key Points/Questions regarding VueX:
- how Vuex is included in Vue? (as plugin, Vue.use(), options,$store)
- why Vuex can be used in any Components? (Vue prototype)
- how Vuex is used in any Components? (dispatch,commit,state, this.$store)
- how does Vue.use(Vuex) work? (install)
- what is default parameter in `actions`?(`this`: point at instance of new Vuex.store)
- Given the parameter in `actions`,can it be changed automatically? (yes, depend on runtime env) How to solve this problem? (hard bind)
- Why the asynchronous code shall be put in `actions`? what type is the return value of `actions`?
- Based on the designed logic of Vuex, How can we optimize the data storage in a Project?





## 2.2 Vue Router 
the link of Youtube Video: 
the Key Points/Questions regarding Vue Router:
- Since Vue Router is also a plug in, what are those characteristics in common?(Vue.use, new Vue({router}), new router...)
- Vue router has `<router-link>` and `<vue-view>` that can be used in any Components, how to realized it? (global components)
- how does `<router-link>` work? (read the attribute "to=", then jump to that link)
- how does `<vue-view>` work?  (connect the view component with the link jumped to)
- How to create global components in non-runtime? What is Vnodes? what does render(h) do?
- is there any  `this` bind issue also in Vue Router?



## 2.3 Components Communication


## 2.4 Reactivity

## 2.5 SSR


# 3. Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
